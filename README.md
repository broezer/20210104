Thus far I have attempted to create gradients for primitive shapes like squares, triangles, circles.
To create these gradients I have to draw lines or arc within a for loop to achieve this. Basically we trick the computer by drawing over the canvas different shapes.
Using the interpolation color function (lerp) I can easily set a beginning and end point.
Also to place the object in the right spot on the canvas I use the translate function. 
I have to wrap my head around all these steps and think differently about creating graphics.
Fun times, wohoo!
